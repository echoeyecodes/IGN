# IGN News App

Always wondered about how NewsApp works under the hood, so I tried writing a custom article parser to render IGN articles as native views on Android.

## How to run project?
No special setup required. Just clone this repo, and run the project.
There are sample HTML articles in the `assets` folder to test with various article besides the default one that gets preloaded.

## I'm up to something
I've been considering building a fully fledged IGN news app with articles, wikis, and videos, etc. 
Already started implementing most of the UI views and activities, but seriously trying to avoid building the backend service for thisðŸ¥². 
If you find this exciting, please reach out so we can work on this together
